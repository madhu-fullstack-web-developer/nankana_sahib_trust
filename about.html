                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Nankana Sahib Education Trust (NSET) was established in honor of Nankana Sahib, the sacred birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. The Trust was created with a vision to promote education, social upliftment, and technological progress, ensuring that students, particularly from rural and economically weaker backgrounds, have access to quality learning opportunities.<br>
                    As a pioneer in technical education, NSET laid the foundation for Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in 1956, with a firm commitment to fostering academic excellence, skill development, and ethical values among students. Since its inception, NSET has remained dedicated to nation-building by producing skilled engineers, researchers, and leaders who contribute significantly to various industries and sectors worldwide.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Nankana Sahib Education Trust was officially registered on 24th February 1953 with the noble mission of uplifting the economically weaker sections of society, particularly in rural India. With this objective in mind, the Trust established a Polytechnic in 1953, followed by the establishment of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in 1956.<br>

A landmark moment in the history of the Trust was on 8th April 1956, when Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the First President of India, laid the foundation stone of GNDEC. Since then, the institution has flourished, with more than 10,000 graduates and 3,000 postgraduates successfully completing their education and making remarkable contributions across various industries in India and abroad.
